## Why a Clorox Coding Repo

This repo is for sharing my results for a coding challenge and an answer to the question "Why do you want this role at CLX DTC?".
</br>
</br>

## clxdtc.js
This file contains my answer to the coding challenge: The program should print the numbers 1 to 100. For multiples of 3, print “CLX” instead of the number and for the multiples of 5, print “DTC”. For numbers that are a multiple of 3 and 5, it should print “CLXDTC”. To see the output of my code follow the instructions below. The file also contains multiple refactored versions for this answer. Just comment out the first first function printClxDtc(), and reference the comments to select the next version of the function printClxDtc().

### Instructions

1. Download the answer file: clxdtc.js
2. Make sure you have node.js installed. [How to install Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
3. After installing node.js, type node clxdtc.js on the command line.
```
node clxdtc.js
```
4. That's it. You should now see the results.
