Hello Mr. Shakespeare,


Thank you for inviting me to share why I would like to work at CLX DTC. The first reason that comes to mind are your posts on Linkedin. I truly appreciate the time and effort you have put into sharing useful advice and motivation to keep up and coming developers moving forward. Your acknowledgement of the disparities in the industry represent the type of language we should all hear from our managers and co-workers where ever we work. I want to be part of any organization that allows its managers to share these insights and also acknowledges the challenges and triumphs that their team goes through to deliver amazing products in a public forum.


The second reason I want to work on the CLX DTC team is the variety and scale of projects this team gets to work on and will work on. Solving problems has always been a passion in my personal and professional life. With such a variety of projects there are endless opportunities to work with diverse teams to come up with creative solutions across a wide variety of product lines. The CLX DTC team would be a perfect place to share my new technological skills while also sharing my experiences and problem solving abilities that I have cultivated in my previous career as an Operations Manager for touring live events. The tools may be different but the passion to deliver amazing experiences to clients while working with amazing and diverse team members is the same.
